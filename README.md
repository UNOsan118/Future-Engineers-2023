## Contents
***
* `t-photos` Pictures of team members
* `v-photos` Images of the car body taken from left, right, front and back, and up and down.
* `video` YouTube link to the demonstration video of the trial run.
* `schemes` Diagrams and descriptions of what electromechanical components are used and how they are connected.
* `src` source code to control the vehicle

# `schemes` The car description.
***
In the `schemes` directory, there are two subdirectories, `mobility` and `power_and_sense`. The `mobility` directory contains mobility management corresponding to reference in the Discussion Section 1, and the `power_and_sense` directory contains power and sense management corresponding to reference in the Discussion Section 2.

# `src` Source code description.
***
The `src` directory contains three subdirectories: `final`, `qualifier`, and `raspi`.
The `final` and `qualifier` directories contain the code used in the Obstacle and Open competitions. Each directory also contains two subdirectories, `raspi` and `spike`, which contain the code for the RaspberryPi and Spike sides separately.
The `raspi` directory contains the program that is executed when the RaspberryPi is started. In the Obstacle competition, the contents of this directory are exactly the same as the `final` - `raspi` directory.
Scattered throughout each directory, the `results` directory contains the video footage of the scenery captured by the camera after the car has actually driven.

Both folders contain a large number of python files, but

Only `color_avoid_wideangle.py` in the `raspi` folder and `main.py` in the `spike` folder are executed at the start of the competition
Other files are imported as modules from the tuning program and the main program.

## Program to run on RaspberryPi.
***
On RasbperryPi, it acquires images from a wide-angle camera, detects signs and walls, and calculates the amount of operation. The camera images are mainly analyzed for the red, green, blue, orange, and black colors on the course, respectively. For this analysis, we use cv2, a Python module for image processing.

**`color_avoid_wideangle.py`**

* Basic Processing

During the competition, this program is executed. It executes `detect_sign_area()` in `color_tracking.py` described below to obtain information on signs, walls, and ground lines.
Then, using that information, it calculates the values given to the steering motor and drive motor of the vehicle body, and sends them to the Hub via serial communication.

* Determining the direction of the lap

At the first corner, the driver decides whether to turn right or left. SPIKE handles the process of going in the opposite direction on the third lap.

* Avoiding Signs

When red or green is visible over a certain area, a sign is determined to be present and the steering value is updated. Here, not only the area of each color but also the x-coordinate is referenced. For example, if a red sign is visible on the left side, the car will pass on the right side if it continues on its path, so the steering value does not need to be increased much. Conversely, if the red sign is on the right, the car will be on the left and the steering value should be increased.

* When turning, recognize the sign ahead and the nearby wall.

When turning a corner, it is difficult to avoid a sign ahead of the turn. Therefore, we use the visible area and y-coordinate of red and green to determine whether there is a sign or not. We also determine if the turn is close to a wall on the right or left side, or not close to a wall at all.This process dramatically increases the sense of stability when turning corners.

**`color_tracking.py`**

This module includes the following functions to recognize signs, walls, etc. from image information.

* `red_detect()`

This function detects and binarizes only the red portion of the image acquired by the camera.
There are also functions that work in the same way for green, blue, orange, and black. 
The following image shows the recognition of a red sign on the course.

* `analysis_blob_line()`, `analysis_blob()`

This function finds connected objects in a binarized image and returns information about the object with the largest area among the objects. It takes a binarized image as an argument.

* `detect_sign_area()`

This function takes a camera image as its argument. Using that image and `analysis_blob_line()`, `analysis_blob()`, and the respective color detects functions, detailed information about the objects on the course is obtained. 

Specifically, the area, coordinates, height, width, center, and other values are calculated for the areas that fall within the thresholds. For walls, the process is divided into three patterns: walls visible on the right side, walls visible on the left side, and walls visible in front. These data are used in the subsequent calculation of steering values.

Also, information from outside the course, such as the reflection of surrounding chairs and desks, can interfere with the analysis of the information inside the course. Therefore, we exclude the parts of the course that are outside of the course in our analysis.

## Programs to run on the SPIKE Hub
***

`main.py`

This program is executed on the Hub during the competition. It imports the module for motor control described below, and controls the car body during the competition based on the external information sent from the RaspberryPi.
It is automatically executed when the Hub is started, and waits for the Home button of the Hub to be pressed. When the home button is pressed, it starts running and controls the vehicle while communicating serially with RaspberryPi.

### Module for motor control
`basic_motion.py`

BasicMotion is a class for controlling basic body motions.
The `move()` function takes a speed of the drive motor (throttle) as argument 1 and a rotation angle of the steering motor (steer) as argument 2, and moves the two motors based on the argument values. The file is now renamed and used as `basic_motion_testUNO.py`.
<br>

`gyro.py`

Gyro is a class required for the operation of adjusting the angle of the car body. The file is now renamed and used as `gyro_testUNO.py`.

The `straightening()` function controls the car body to be at a reference angle.
It requests the speed (throttle) of the drive motor in argument 1 and runs at that speed

The `change_steer()` function changes the direction in which the car should go (reference angle).
It requests the speed of the drive motor (throttle) as argument 1 and the turning direction of the car body (rot) as argument 2. (Argument 3 is basically not used.)
Change the reference angle to be used in straightening() when the vehicle recognizes the blue or orange line.


# Writing and executing programs to SPIKE Hub
***

### Launching the Mu Editor
    
Open a Linux terminal on Raspi and execute the following command.

`pi@raspberry: ~$ source ~/mu-venv/bin/activate`<br>
`pi@raspberry: ~$ mu-editor`

### Change of description language
The program to be executed on the RaspberryPi is written in Python, while the program to be executed on the Hub is written in MicroPythonï¼Ž

### Upload Program
If you want to upload files from RaspberryPi to SPIKE, click the following button to access the file system on the Hub and drag and drop the files you want to upload.
<img src="./other/mu_upload.png" width="100%">

During a trial run, the program can be run on the Hub by clicking the Run button on the Mu Editor. However, during a competition, you need to click a button on the Hub to start the run, and since the Hub runs a Python file named main.py when it starts up, you should upload the program to be used during the competition with the name main.py.
